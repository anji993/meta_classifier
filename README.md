# Few-Shot Goal Inference for Visuomotor Learning and Planning

This repository contains code and data for training a few-shot success classifier as well as a pretrained model for the Sawyer experiment from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00482">Few-Shot Goal Inference for Visuomotor Learning and Planning</a>. First, download the data by running `scripts/get_sawyer_data.sh`. Run `scripts/train_classifier.sh` to train a classifier from scratch, or run `scripts/test_classifier.sh` to test the provided pretrained model.
